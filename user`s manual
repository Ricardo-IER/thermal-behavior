The "Thermal_behavior" code consists on four parts: The first part comprises variable declaration; the second part consists of
assigning values to all variables, according to the fluid and the formation thermo-physical properties, initial temperatures, 
domain size and simulation time.  The third part performs the calculations for obtaining the systems of equations obtained by 
discretizing the partial differential equations as well as its solution. Lastly, an option is given to present on screen the point 
temperature values of all nodes in the domain
